# English_Excel_Project
****************

**Under Development**

## Introduction
**************
**English Excel** is a project that is planned to be deployed in many stages, which has a specific aim/purpose, which is to provide the public, whether they have good experience/ability using a computer or not, with a very high-level interface to deal with and manipulate data and tables, especially complex operations that need the experience to do it, and that should be by only writing English words and sentences that describe the process or the operation the person wants to do. In addition to helping people with no experience in using computer/excel or making the job easy for the ones who can, our project has a vision that by implementing it, it will make it easier for visually impaired people to make a more complex use in a simpler way, for spreadsheets applications like excel and google sheets.


## Project's Functions
****************
Please refer to this **[Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17WzV-W7HQ3XcJ7myyZlAuGElQq6yvE9q_bbXr-z3QOY/edit#gid=0)** to check the use cases and the functional requirements of the project

## Research and Motivation
****************
During our journey of study, specifically as a university student, I realized that we and every other major came to a time where we had to deal with data, analyze it, interpret it and manipulate it. As a computer science student, I and my friends found our way through programming and data analysis tools, but most of the other students were mainly dependent on spreadsheets applications like excel or google sheets, and they weren’t aware of other methods to use, or they weren’t interested in learning it because of some stereotypes they have about how hard it is to program and so on. 

From that point of view that I had, I also saw something else, which is the base of my hypothesis. I was aware of excel's complex and average functionalities and how to use it on a scale; that was when I was an intern in a specific company. I saw that most of those people depend on spreadsheets as their primary method to manipulate data, and at the same time, they don’t usually practice any challenging or complex use for it, which makes them forget how to use and implement the complex functionalities of those applications, and even for the average ones. From that point, we made our hypothesis.

**Hypothesis**:

From our observation, and further look and research, we came up with the following hypothesis:

***“It is hard, challenging and time-consuming for non-experts and new spreadsheets users to perform average complexity data operations whether absolutely or in an acceptable time and quality”***

## Project structure
****************
#### Please Note that: - the project will, God willing, be written in python then will be re-written in Java as well, for practice reasons and as a step to create a mobile application as well.
